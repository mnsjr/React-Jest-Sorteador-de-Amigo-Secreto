# React JS | Jest

The application was developed following the Test Driven Development (TDD) methodology.
Using the following stacks:

- React JS | TypeScript
- Jest: to write the tests
- React Router Dom: to manage the routing
- Recoil: to manage the temporary information

The application consists of software that receives the names of participants for a secret Santa draw.

The result is delivered to the user by selecting their name, the secret Santa drawn is displayed on the screen for one and a half seconds, and then it requests that another participant select their name, in order to not reveal the drawn participant to another participant. 

The screen that displays the result also shows a restart button, which restarts the application.
